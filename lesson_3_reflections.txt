When would you want to create a remote repository rather than store all your files locally?
I would do this if I am working in collaboration with others as it would allow us all to easily access the files and make changes to the project
I would also do this if I knew I would be switching between different computers and would need access to the same files from these varying locations

Why might I want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with my remote repository?
Pulling manually allows me to dictate what is publically available for all to see, or in the cae of a private account what my collaborators can see
This is important as maybe I am working on some very buggy code that I do not want others to see before its ready or maybe I am working on proprietary software that needs to be kept private

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. WHen would one be used instead of others?
A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub that retains a link or connections back to the original create of the work
A clone is a copy of a given repository, either from local space to local space or from GitHub to your local drive
A branch is simply an alternate copy of a repository in which at some previous time changes have been made to it that have not been committed to the master
A fork would be used when one wants to use someone elses work to either improve on it or change parts of it to suit their needs
A clone would be used if someone directly wants a copy of come code in a repository
A branch would be used if you wanted to try some experimental changes in a project without compromise the original or master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the remote stored locally means you can diff your work or brach with the copy of the remote to see how it differs and how you have changed it

How would I collaborate without GitHub, what would be easier/harder?
Without GitHub collarboration would require disciplined cooperation and scheduled meeting constantly to see that everyone is
on the same page, comparing each others work would be harder and we would need constantly be making sure what we are working
on was up to date with each other.
