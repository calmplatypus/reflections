When would you want to create a remote repository rather than store all your files locally?
I would do this if I am working in collaboration with others as it would allow us all to easily access the files and make changes to the project
I would also do this if I knew I would be switching between different computers and would need access to the same files from these varying locations

Why might I want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with my remote repository?
Pulling manually allows me to dictate what is publically available for all to see, or in the cae of a private account what my collaborators can see
This is important as maybe I am working on some very buggy code that I do not want others to see before its ready or maybe I am working on proprietary software that needs to be kept private
